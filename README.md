#Base Blockchain Address Verifier

A simple decentralized application (DApp) built to verify Ethereum-style addresses on the Base blockchain. This project helps users avoid errors by ensuring they are using valid Base-compatible addresses.

## Features
- Verify Ethereum-compatible addresses on the Base blockchain.
- Display whether an address is valid or invalid.
- (Optional) Interact with a smart contract to check if the address holds Base tokens.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Node.js and npm installed.
- Truffle installed globally (`npm install -g truffle`).
- A Base-compatible wallet (e.g., MetaMask) for development and testing.

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/base-address-verifier.git
   cd base-address-verifier
   npm install
   npm start
   Open your browser and go to http://localhost:3000 to view the DApp.
